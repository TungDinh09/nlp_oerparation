# NLP Preparation FastAPI Project

This project provides a FastAPI web application that cleans text data from different sources, such as Coursera and YouTube. It exposes a simple API and frontend for users to interact with and clean their text data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- FastAPI (with standard dependencies)
- Uvicorn (for development server)
- Pydantic (for data validation)
- Regular expressions (`re` - part of Python's standard library)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp_oerparation.git
cd nlp_oerparation
```

### 2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

Create a virtual environment in the `.venv` folder:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On macOS/Linux:**

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

- **On Windows (Command Prompt):**

    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

- **On Windows (PowerShell):**

    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file includes:
- `fastapi[standard]` for FastAPI and its standard dependencies.
- `uvicorn` for running the FastAPI server.
- `re` is used for regular expressions (though it's built into Python).

### 4. **Run the FastAPI Development Server**

To run the FastAPI application, use the following command:

```bash
uvicorn nlp_perpararion.main:app --reload
```

This command starts the FastAPI server, with `--reload` for automatic reloading during development.

### 5. **Access the Application**

Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

This will display the Swagger UI, where you can interact with the API.

### 6. **Stopping the Server**

To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.

## Directory Structure

```
nlp_oerparation/
├── nlp_perpararion/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py           # FastAPI app entry point
│   ├── routes/

├── requirements.txt      # Project dependencies
└── .gitignore            # Git ignore file
```

## .gitignore

Make sure to add the `.venv` folder and other unnecessary files to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being tracked by Git. Here's an example `.gitignore`:

```
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
*.env
```

## Troubleshooting

- **If you encounter errors about missing modules**: Ensure you've installed the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **If the server fails to start**: Ensure you're using a supported Python version (3.7+).

### Key Changes in This README:
- **Clarified the use of `fastapi[standard]`** in the requirements, so you’re aware of what dependencies FastAPI includes.
- **Detailed steps for virtual environment creation and activation**, as well as installing dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Clear structure** for setting up, running, and stopping the FastAPI app.

### `requirements.txt` (again for clarity):

```plaintext
fastapi[standard]
uvicorn
re
```

This file should be in the root directory of your project, and running `pip install -r requirements.txt` will install all dependencies needed for your FastAPI project.

Let me know if you need further adjustments!
